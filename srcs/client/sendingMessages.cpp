   Command: PRIVMSG
   Parameters: <msgtarget> <text to be sent>

   PRIVMSG is used to send private messages between users, as well as to
   send messages to channels.  <msgtarget> is usually the nickname of
   the recipient of the message, or a channel name.

   The <msgtarget> parameter may also be a host mask (#<mask>) or server
   mask ($<mask>).  In both cases the server will only send the PRIVMSG
   to those who have a server or host matching the mask.  The mask MUST
   have at least 1 (one) "." in it and no wildcards following the last
   ".".  This requirement exists to prevent people sending messages to
   "#*" or "$*", which would broadcast to all users.  Wildcards are the
   '*' and '?'  characters.  This extension to the PRIVMSG command is
   only available to operators.

   Numeric Replies:

           ERR_NORECIPIENT                 ERR_NOTEXTTOSEND
           ERR_CANNOTSENDTOCHAN            ERR_NOTOPLEVEL
           ERR_WILDTOPLEVEL                ERR_TOOMANYTARGETS
           ERR_NOSUCHNICK
           RPL_AWAY

/*
      Command: NOTICE
   Parameters: <msgtarget> <text>

   The NOTICE command is used similarly to PRIVMSG.  The difference
   between NOTICE and PRIVMSG is that automatic replies MUST NEVER be
   sent in response to a NOTICE message.  This rule applies to servers
   too - they MUST NOT send any error reply back to the client on
   receipt of a notice.  The object of this rule is to avoid loops
   between clients automatically sending something in response to
   something it received.

   This command is available to services as well as users.

   This is typically used by services, and automatons (clients with
   either an AI or other interactive program controlling their actions).

   See PRIVMSG for more details on replies and examples.
